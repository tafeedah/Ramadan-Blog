                                <p class="drop-cap">As we are set for this year&#39;s Ramadan, our Ramadan blog series
                                    has a number of informtive and educational write-ups.</p>

                                <p>Reciting the Qur'an is a highly rewarded act of worship. The Prophet mentioned in
                                    this regard, "Whoever recites a single letter from the Qur'an will have a reward,
                                    and that reward will be multiplied tenfold. Do not say that "Alif-Lam-Mim" is a
                                    single letter. Rather, "Alif" is a distinct letter, "Lam" is a distinct letter, and
                                    "Mim" is a distinct letter."1 One cannot begin to imagine the reward of a believer
                                    who recites the entire Qur'an in its entirety once, twice or thrice during the month
                                    of Ramadan.</p>



                                <p>With its 6332 ayas &#40;sentences&#41; spread in 114 suras &#40;chapters&#41; divided
                                    in seven
                                    stages and 30 parts, the Quran was finalized and compiled in the life time of the
                                    Prophet who alone among human beings knew what it was. Only the Prophet could
                                    testify, verify and approve what the Quran consisted of as no other human being in
                                    his time shared that experience. He put his seal of approval on the finality of the
                                    divine message and gave his instructions on its arrangement. The Prophet ensured
                                    that every verse revealed to him was recorded and written at the time of its
                                    revelation</p>


                                <p>In one of the several ahadiths (statements attributed to the Prophet) mentioned in
                                    Sahih Bukhari, one of the companions, Bara'a narrates that when the verse: </p>

                                <blockquote>not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home) except those who are
                                    disabled (by injury or are blind or lame), and those who strive hard and fight in
                                    the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives, Allah has preferred in grades
                                    those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who
                                    sit (at home) to each Allah has promised good, but has preferred those who strive
                                    hard and fight, above those who sit (at home by a huge reward.<cite>
                                        Al Quran 4:95</cite></blockquote>


                                <p>was revealed, the prophet immediately called one of the scribes of the Quran to bring
                                    in the ink, pen, and the tablet so that it could be written down.</p>



                                <p>The greatest miracle of the Quran is the consistency of this message evident in all
                                    its suras (chapters) and ayas (sentences). The linguistic beauty and style are
                                    apparent to only those who understand the language but the clarity and consistency
                                    of the message is for everyone regardless of their linguistic skills and they
                                    relevant for all times. In other words every sura of the Quran is connected with its
                                    overall message with variations in emphasis and every aya is related with a
                                    particular aspect of the message within the context of the total guidance.

                                </p>



                                <p>Thus the month of Ramadan offers the believers a unique opportunity to refresh
                                    their understanding of the guidance and live it for an entire month so that the
                                    life in coming months could be disciplined around that. Thus, the first task for
                                    every believer is to get connected with the divine guidance in a disciplined,
                                    consistent, and regular basis.</p>


                                <p>The fasting enables a person to live the principle of self control and self
                                    discipline, which is essential to realize the strength and relevance of the divine
                                    message.</p>

                                    <p>Seemingly, a large number of Muslims do not know the Arabic language and hence find
                                    it hard to understand when the Quran is recited to them. Moreover, we have the
                                    traditions informing us that the reading of the Quran gives us the reward of reading
                                    one letter to the equivalent to the 30 letter reward. The mercy and the divine
                                    measurement for good deeds are limitless and this narration should be read in that
                                    context.</p>

                                    <p>Besides earning reward for reading the Quran without understanding, we can also make
                                    efforts in the month of Ramadan to read it with understanding. This may even double
                                    or triple the reward. It is no harm to read the Quran with translation. Non-Arabic
                                    speaking believers can recite the Quran in Arabic and listen to its pronunciation
                                    during the taraweeh prayers, besides reading the translation in their own languages
                                    to understand the essence of the divine message. This understanding will enable us
                                    to get closer to the guidance of Allah.</p>

                                    <p>Often it is argued that it is difficult to understand the Quran in any other
                                    language. The Quran, on the other hand repeats the following verse four times:</p> 
                                    <blockquote>And
                                        We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any
                                        that will receive admonition? <cite>Al-Quran 54:17</cite> </blockquote>  
                                        <p> Besides, the Quran also says: </p> 
                                        <blockquote>And among His
                                            Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variations in your
                                            languages and your colors: verily in that are Signs for those who know. <cite>Al-Quran 30:22</cite> </blockquote> 

                                            <p>The reading of the Quran with meaning would give us an opportunity to understand the
                                    divine message as is and inspire us to appreciate its relevance for us in our times.
                                    Thus in addition to reading the Quran, we can also make efforts to live it.</p>

                                    <p>We spend much of our efforts in correcting our pronunciation of the Quran. This is
                                    good and the proper sound of every letter and word must be perfected authentically.
                                    However, the main purpose of perfecting the pronunciation must never be ignored:
                                    i.e. to understand so that we could live the Quran, the way our Prophet lived it.
                                </p>


                                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>During the month of Ramadan we arrange lavish functions for the breaking of fast, a
                                    good practice to bring people together. However, if in these functions, we make it a
                                    habit to focus on understanding one of the passages of the Quran, probably we can
                                    make better use of these gatherings. It would not take us more than 5 to 10 minutes
                                    to reflect on the message of the Quran in these functions, but it would help us
                                    understand the divine guidance, the main reason for decreeing fasting in this month.

                                     <blockquote>The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and
                                        clear proofs for the guidance and the Criterion (between right and wrong). So,
                                        whoever of you sights the month, he/she must observe fasts that month and whoever is
                                        ill or on a journey, the same number (of days which one did not observe fasts must
                                        be made up) from other days. Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to
                                        make things difficult for you. He wants that you must complete the same number of
                                        days and that you must glorify Allah for having to guided you so that you may be
                                        grateful to Him. <cite>Al-Quran 2:184</cite> </blockquote>

                                <p>O&#39; Allah, allow us to live to see Ramadan, ameen.</p>
